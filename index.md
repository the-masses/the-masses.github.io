## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="./img/profile_pic.jpg">

I am an upcoming PhD student in the Intelligent Transportation Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), supervised by [Prof. Changhao Chen](https://changhao-chen.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my master's degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Fmrv3J8AAAAJ&hl=en). During my master's degree, I also joined [Prof. Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/)'s group in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore as a research intern. Piror to that, I received my bachelor's degree from the School of Automation at Beijing Institute of Technology.
